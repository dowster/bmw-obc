Looking at the 5 pin header on the PCB there is a + marking near the "top" which I'll use as pin 1. 
To keep it simple, Pin 1 on the PCB header connects to Pin 1 on the ribbon cable from the display.
Pin 1 is possibly the +5v feed.
Pin 2 seems to be a PWM signal to control the opacity of the LCD segments
Pin 3 the data line
Pin 4 is the clock signal
Pin 5 is the ground

during the pause on the last message set the data line high just before setting clock low
