# 80s BMW On-Board Computer Hacking

The purpose of this project is to rebuild the internals of the BMW OBC found in the e24/28/30 cars. All the internals will be replaced except for the backlight, display, and keypad circuitry. To accomplish this I'll need to reverse engineer the [display protocol](./docs/display-protocol.md) and reverse engineer the keypad controls.
